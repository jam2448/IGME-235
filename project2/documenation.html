        My process began with me choosing the pokemon API because I enjoy playing pokemon go.
       
        <br>
        Along the way of making this, I copied a fair amount of javasctipt
        from the gif finder and used it as a jump start to figure out how to get the API to work. Whenever I was lost or neeeded help,
        <br>
        I would consult my good friend Chat GPT to correct bugs and errors that I got in my code or the API documentation to figure out what I wanted to search for
        and the limits of the api. I ran into a lot of roadblocks when it came to putting the pokemon in an array, and sorting by it using the 
        specific parameters that I had. I believe it was mainly due to the fact that arrays work differently in Javascript than they are used in C#, and 
        the subtle differences confused me quite a bit.

        <br>
        There is not anything special in the webiste other than what you can search for using the 3 ways of search,  however you can search for both type and color at the same time!
        which was actually something that I never thought about until I was testing the webpage.
        <br>
        I met the requirements by having 3 search terms, having it look very nice, and the code functions the way 
        that I want it to without any errors (hopefully).
        <br>
        I believe that I did well on this project, and think I should get a 90.
