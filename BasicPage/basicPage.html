    <h1>Description</h1>

        <h4>
            <b><em>Trouble</em></b> (known as Frustration in the UK and Kimble in Finland) is a family board game in which <b>2-4 players</b> compete to be the first to send four 
        pieces all the way around a board. Pieces are moved according to the roll of a die using a contained device called a <b>"Pop-O-Matic"</b>. 
        Games can usually take around 45 minutes to copmlete. It is called trouble due to the frustrating randomness of the game as the players'
        fate is in the hands of a dice roll in the Pop-O-Matic.

    <h1>Quote</h1>

    <blockquote>
        However, it improves upon the original, in my opinion, by virtue of simplification and shortening,
        and is now rendered what it should have been recognized as all along: a children's game.
         While the decisions to be made are limited, there is enough strategy here to engage beginning gamers, 
         and the delightful fun of the pop-o-matic makes even the roll-and-move mechanics charming for parents and other patient adults impressed into a game.
