        <h1><u>My Favorite Dishes</u></h1>
        <p>
            This is a list of of my favorite dishes that I have cooked in the past year. All of the photos taken 
            were cooked by me and taken by me. All recipes used are accessible by clicking the title of each dish if one exists.
            FYI:  all of the meals cooked were absolutely scrumptious!
